# RecyclerView with DataBinding using ViewModel, LiveData and Retrofit

Android Architecture Components are a part of Android Jetpack.

Some the Android Architecture Components are used.

1 - ViewModel: It manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way. It stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations.

2 - LiveData: It notifies views of any database changes. Use LiveData to build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.

3 - Data Binding: It helps in declaratively binding UI elements to in our layout to data sources of our app.
